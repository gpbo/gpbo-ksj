Gitpod Branchout environment development

By opening this repo in Gitpod you will get:

* A docker container with some foundational tools
* A gitpod user on (https://gitpod.io)
* Homebrew (https://brew.sh)
* Branchout (https://github.com/branchout/branchout)
* A few example repositories that show the power of the two together

## Commands you need to run next

```
branchout init
branchout pull
```

## TODO

* fast java builds with konico and jib
* kubectl installed and configured
* access to your own kube namespace so you can run your own cluster to develop services against
